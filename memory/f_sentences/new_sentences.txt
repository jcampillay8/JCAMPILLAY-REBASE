all halls lead somewhere
well, I didn't mean to
It would seem you've had quite an adventure
this has gone on long enough
I thought you would want to know
he'll come to no harm
it really is that simple
these principles should apply to any software project
reducing complexity to simplicity
which burned so bad she had to bite her lip to keep from screaming
there was something oddly familiar about him
It would seem you've had quite an adventure
the guards exchanged a glance
have intelligent conversations that lead to sensible plans
he had seldom felt quite so alone
if it exists at all
We learned that to our sorrow
we ask that you use common courtesy and respect
across his lap
have a care how you address my betrothed
refusing to believe
but the queen never so much as looked at him
That was where they headed
you will rue this insolent behavior
he answered reluctantly
a man gets only what he earns
your children were meant to have these pups
they were brutes and bullies
to be lavish
That's true enough
even her handmaids noticed the change
You ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains

It is past time that we reviewed the figures

Our partners have been a key contributor to this achievement
Stick them with the pointy end
we have in plenty
he had been a sly child
she sagged with relief
yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled
slamming his head against the packed earth
to ease his pain
brook no argument
it might have taught her a lesson
every metal known to man
debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves
he has a fearsome aspect
Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer
stretch away
no wonder
clenched tightly
though the library was snug and warm
Catelyn ignored the implied question
she wouldn't let him spoil it
his blunt words startled her
I've heard so much of
Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it
you're spoiling it
and we must not neglect the other costs
let us call a halt for today
she had aged twenty years
scrabbled in the swirling waters
a brothel
no offense intended
Jon said warily
it would look queer if your family did not attend
he said derisively
you know full well
so I yielded
hostage and ward
at the manse that had been Drogo's
Robert grasped Ned by the elbow
would that we could
She remembered him dimly
he hardly ever spoke to them, if he could help it
I had not thought you so niggardly
The name it bore
you can tell them apart if you listen close
She should have realized
So long as he pays the price
I shudder to think
groggy from sleep
all is settled
She was to have been his bride
scarcely lift
Robb sheathed his sword
held steadily on
so long as they are left in peace
auditable and reliable
yet if I set it down, who will pick it up?
if those years were to have any meaning
I do not mean to frighten you, but neither will I lie to you
should have thought that heat ill suits you
I have a realistic grasp of
that only made it hurt the worse
His legs were stiff and sore
Lysa ought to have been honored
he muttered sourly
the room was crowded when he burst in
You fret too much
too old and too weary for the burden I bear
he was so frail and thin
I was captured by a whim
makes you wonder what lies beyond
I do believe you mean it
the way a man was meant to
wailing of women
will haunt
you never know what you might learn
Tyrion found himself oddly touched
he stifled his laughter
Jon relished the stories they were telling
both in mourning, and full of anger
ruffled his hair
the way you dress, for one
We ought to count ourselves fortunate
I am surrounded by flatterers
that does not mean I must subject my daughters to this folly
Ned knew better than to defy him
well bred
I would sooner not speak of her
I don't suppose it matters, truly
the harbor was crowded with ships
we must replenish our stores
he voyage had been long and fatiguing
his voice thick with doubt
His eyes stung
Robb looked relieved
although he did not think he ever really fooled her
at first it had not come easy
then she whirled
they had remained aloof from the struggle
his voice was thick with longing
it would stop the itching
looking for some way to salvage it
rotten beams
lest we start to take ourselves too seriously
disdainful way he looked at
Grenn loomed over him
wrenched the knife from the wood
it's up to you
she smiled uncertainty at the compliment
on wary
he was not much a one for sleeping
flung him
Lord Tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses
clutching a bunch flowers
Mormont said bluntly
to warn of intruders
His eyes were haunted
I could not bear it
her scrawny little sister in disbelief
Sansa had never had much of a head for figures
it was dusk
She looked as though
Ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than
I never meant to frighten the girl
his sly arrogance of the comment rankled him
keep out of matters that don't concern you
he feigned a yawn
as befitted
reassured her
perhaps a sprain
it was better not to speak of the things you wanted
in earnest
fond of flowers
those pleasures were taking a toll
Perhaps I should withdraw
the grief came on her all at once
there were great elk in that wood
he had been so heartsick and weary
it was there at the bottom of the chest
her distress was quickly forgotten
two men I deemed as good as
yet I do tire easily, I fear
Ned was stunned
reading the words with mounting disbelief
you are a hard man to fool
Jon swelled with pride
Jon knew better than to reply
just as she'd feared
wondering if this day would ever end
you'll never be free of the mockery
Ned was aghast
laws are a tedious business
he was stubborn and loyal to a fault
far be it from me to dissuade you
he scarcely recognized
He looked nonplussed
Robert grumbled
I'm thrilled to announce that
wiping his mouth
spare me the foolishness
a beard as coarse
the accusation is treason either way
Viserys gaped at him, and sat down in the dirt
then giggled
The words came unbidden
ofttimes he knows about it before it happens
the markets bursting with food
a look of wry contempt
The wind swirled around him
the others were climbing the ridge
do remind her to dress nicely today
brought forth
that won't do any good
Ned followed him warily
if you are so eager to
and whose fault is that
attracts unwelcome attention
sullen companions
self-taught
Ned could not help but notice
when it comes to that creature
the parchment is very dry
there was tightness in him
the fall had shrunken him somehow
and put an end to this nonsense
the weariness came on him suddenly
clutching my leg and crying
all this talk is getting very tiresome
he came of age
stuffy room
he tossed her one of the wooden blades
Arya brooded silently all day long
Arya had a way of ruining everything
it would not do to have you recognized
what do you make of his report
That would be most fitting
I have more pressing concerns
he said with loathing
The man did have a temper
It was more than he could bear
I could scarce sleep last night
Robert can barely stomach his brothers
I'll take that wager
baring his fangs
you're a cunning man
I am touched by your concern
he must have heard her
Bran thought spitefully
he wanted it to be the way it had been before
it would never be the way it had been
Bran watched forlornly from his window
women smothered their children rather than see them starve
this ought to work
I should have thought of this myself
Robb seemed puzzled
your brother Jon asked it of me
spare me your false courtesies
Ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his chest
It is not so, yet ofttimes it feels that way
to put your mind at ease
I fear you would find it of little interest
you have been most courteous
but we know it is not always so
your feet should be farther apart
he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen
Jon Snow took a step forward
what sort of man would proclaim himself a coward?
It must have been warmer where you come from
how dreadful
the sooner this folly is done with, the better I shall like it
as if the expense and trouble were not irksome enough
remember the time he proposed to outlaw brothels?
and Ned felt certain he had reasons
he had given no word as to when he might return
the matter nagged at him
Ned was not sure what to make of Renly
he might have changed his views
making a fool
a deal handier
at daybreak
at daybreak
it set forth
closely trimmed
a broad range of experience
fair skin
he glimpsed a figure standing in the shade
pointed out
give her my regards
she rescued him without regard for herself
she rescued him without regard for herself
driven away
