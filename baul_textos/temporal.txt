I'm thrilled to announce that
Our partners have been a key contributor to this achievement
auditable and reliable
he had been so heartsick and weary
the room was crowded when he burst in
I never meant to frighten the girl
you know full well
he stifled his laughter
filthy
I had not thought you so niggardly
he answered reluctantly
that won't do any good
He looked nonplussed
the harbor was crowded with ships
the voyage had been long and fatiguing
mistreated
he was stubborn and loyal to a fault
Catelyn ignored the implied question
he had been a sly child
ofttimes he knows about it before it happens
Jon knew better than to reply
the weariness came on him suddenly
that only made it hurt the worse
a man gets only what he earns
Grenn loomed over him
he hardly ever spoke to them, if he could help it
they were brutes and bullies
slamming his head against the packed earth
perhaps a sprain
it's up to you
Jon said warily
makes you wonder what lies beyond
you never know what you might learn
it was better not to speak of the things you wanted
you'll never be free of the mockery
keep out of matters that don't concern you
I'll take that wager
the way you dress, for one
he sly arrogance of the comment rankled him
I should have thought that heat ill suits you
yet I do tire easily, I fear
every metal known to man
reading the words with mounting disbelief
and we must not neglect the other costs
and we must not neglect the other costs
we have in plenty
spare me the foolishness
Ned was stunned
Ned was aghast
let us call a halt for today
Arya brooded silently all day long
Ned followed him warily
wondering if this day would ever end
oak
you are a hard man to fool
dizzying
a brothel
it would not do to have you recognized
both in mourning, and full of anger
your children were meant to have these pups
wrenched the knife from the wood
the accusation is treason either way
if you are so eager to
far be it from me to dissuade you
you're a cunning man
You ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains
no offense intended
lest we start to take ourselves too seriously
I am touched by your concern
Mormont said bluntly
so I yielded
two men I deemed as good as
yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled
too old and too weary for the burden I bear,
yet if I set it down, who will pick it up?
if those years were to have any meaning
Lord Tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses
I was captured by a whim
to ease his pain
Tyrion found himself oddly touched
that does not mean I must subject my daughters to this folly
it would look queer if your family did not attend
it was there at the bottom of the chest
you will rue this insolent behavior
I don't suppose it matters, truly
and put an end to this nonsense
the grief came on her all at once
I do not mean to frighten you, but neither will I lie to you
he tossed her one of the wooden blades
the others were climbing the ridge
she wouldn't let him spoil it
at first it had not come easy
relentlessly
Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer
even her handmaids noticed the change
there were great elk in that wood
Viserys gaped at him, and sat down in the dirt
his blunt words startled her
so long as they are left in peace
his voice was thick with longing
it was dusk
He woke gasping
Bran snapped
Bran thought spitefully
he wanted it to be the way it had been before
it would never be the way it had been
Bran watched forlornly from his window
women smothered their children rather than see them starve
this ought to work
I should have thought of this myself
Robb seemed puzzled
your brother Jon asked it of me
spare me your false courtesies
Ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his chest
It is not so, yet ofttimes it feels that way
his speech was too slurred to comprehend
to put your mind at ease
I fear you would find it of little interest
you have been most courteous
but we know it is not always so
swaying
your feet should be farther apart
he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen
I yield
Jon Snow took a step forward
what sort of man would proclaim himself a coward?
It must have been warmer where you come fromi
wincing
how dreadful
the sooner this folly is done with, the better I shall like it
as if the expense and trouble were not irksome enough
remember the time he proposed to outlaw brothels?
and Ned felt certain he had reasons
he had given no word as to when he might return
the matter nagged at him
Ned was not sure what to make of Renly
he might have changed his views
