Value What do we mean by "value" in the equation? The simplest definition of value would be: The degree to which this change helps anybody anywhere. The most important people to help are your users. However, writing in features that will help you support yourself financially is also a form of value--it's valuable to you. In fact, there are many ways a change can have value; these are just two examples. Sometimes, determining the actual, precise numerical value of any particular change is difficult. For example, say your software helps people lose weight. How do you measure the exact value of helping somebody lose weight? You can't, really. But you can know with precision that some features of the software will help people lose weight a lot and some features won't help people lose weight at all. So, you can still rank changes by their value. Understanding the value of each possible change comes mostly from experience as a developer and from doing proper research with users to find out what will help them the most. Probability of value and potential value Value is actually composed of two factors: the probability of value (how likely it is that this change will help a user), and the potential value (how much this change will help a user during those times when it does help that person).
